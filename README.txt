This directory is a workspace for the OpenOME SDK.

[Configuration]
The eclipse-%version%-%os%.bat will invoke the eclipse SDK. 
Make sure the SDK is installed under the %ECLIPSE_HOME% and the
required plugins are installed under the corresponding links directories.

[headless build and testing]
The update site of the OpenOME feature can be built and tested
by calling ant under current directory.

The build correctly, please make sure the script under
edu.toronto.cs.ome.eclipse.update/build.xml points to the right 
Eclipse PDE_BUILD script directory.

The test correctly, please make sure the SDK and required features such
as EMF, TEST, OPENOME, OPENOME.TEST are all installed within a different
ECLIPSE_HOME directory.

The following plugin projects will be generated by the EMF code generator
based on the models in the edu.toronto.cs.model directory.
------------------------------
bpel
bpel.edit
bpel.editor
bpel.tests
edu.toronto.cs.goalmodel
edu.toronto.cs.goalmodel.edit
edu.toronto.cs.goalmodel.editor
edu.toronto.cs.goalmodel.tests
------------------------------

The goal editor plugins are generated from a set of annotated Java programs:
   src += src/actor.java
   src += src/goal.java
   src += src/dependency.java
   src += src/contribution.java
   src += src/topic.java
   src += src/property.java
   src += src/ActorType.java
   src += src/DecompositionType.java
   src += src/ContributionType.java
   src += src/LabelType.java
	create a new EMF model based on these annotated Java
	open the generated goal.genmodel
	right click
	generate all	

The BPEL editor plugins are generated from a set of XSD schema:
   src += BPEL2WS.xsd 
   src += properties.xsd 
   src += partener-link.xsd 
   src += XMI.xsd
	new EMF project based on XSD
	project name = bpel
	load the BPEL2WS.xsd
	choose both process and wsdl
	a bpel.genmodel will be generated in the bpel/model directory
	then open this file
	right click
	generate all
