This interface represents Telos attributes. These are <em>first class 
 objects</em> in Telos. They can be declared by any non-primitive proposition
 (omega class, token, simple class, metaclass, metametaclass, etc.).
 <p>Like all Telos propositions, each attribute is made up of the three primary
 components <em>source</em>, <em>label</em> and <em>destination</em>. These
 three components may be retrieved by the methods <code>from()</code>, 
 <code>label()</code> and <code>to()</code> inherited from the interface
 <code>Proposition</code>. For attributes, the source component is always 
 another proposition and can be thought of as the <em>declarer</em> of the
 attribute. The destination component of an attribute is either a proposition
 or a primitive literal and can be thought of as the <em>value</em> of the 
 attribute. Note that as with all propositions, the level of instantiation of 
 an attribute's source component need not be the same as the level of 
 instantiation of the attribute's destination component (note that by 
 convention, a primitive literal is considered to be at the token level of
 instantiation. In particular, this means that a token could declare, say, an
 attribute whose value is an M4Class, and an M2Class could declare an attribute
 whose value is a primitive literal such as the integer `5'.
 <p>Like all Telos propositions, each Attribute has a level of (Telos)
 instantiation. By convention, the level of instantiation for an attribute is
 given by the level of instantiation of its target. The rationalle behind this
 convention derives from the Instantiation Constraint in Telos: If a 
 proposition <code>p</code> is an instance of proposition <code>q</code> then
 <code>from(p)</code> must be an instance of <code>from(q)</code> and 
 <code>to(p)</code> must be an instance of <code>to(q)</code>. Hence, an 
 attribute may only be instantiated as many times as its target can be 
 instantiated. Strictly speaking the level of instantiation of an attribute 
 should be the minimum of the level of instantiation of its source and target 
 (i.e., its <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> propositions); however, this
 convention has not been adopted. Note that attributes need not be instances
 of only other attributes. Indeed, all attributes are instances of the Omega
 level individual <code>Proposition</code> as well as instances of the 
 appropriate "level" builtin individual (e.g., <code>Token</code>,
 <code>SClass</code>, <code>M1Class</code>, etc) as determined by the level of
 instantiation for the attribute.
 <p>We now introduce the concept of <em>inherited</em> attributes in Telos.
 The Telos "Specialization Postulate" says that if a class <code>P</code> is a 
 specialization of a class <code>Q</code> and <code>p</code> is an instance of
 <code>P</code>, then <code>p</code> is an instance of <code>Q</code>. It
 follows by the specialization postulate that an instance of a class 
 <code>P</code> can declare attributes that instantiate class level attributes
 from <code>P</code>'s parents. Accordingly, we say that a class "inherits" 
 all of its parents' class level attributes since the class's instances can
 instantiate its parents class level attributes. To be more correct, a class
 inherits those class level attributes declared by its parents that are not
 specialized by any other attributes amongst the class's declared attributes
 or amongst the class's parents' declared attributes. This is done to avoid
 redundancy: if an attribute is an instance of some other attribute, then by 
 the specialization postulate it is also an instance of the other attribute's
 parents.
 <p>Unlike individuals, attributes have <em>categories</em>. These are the 
 labels of all the attribute's ancestors. Consequently any implementation
 of this interface must support the method <code>categories</code> inherited
 from the Proposition interface.
 <p>The Telos language allows attributes to themselves have attributes. Some
 implementations of this API may choose to not support this.
 <p><b>In this API, attributes are constructed by a method in the 
 <code>KB</code> interface, not by a public constructor</b>. The method is
 called
 <code>newAttribute(Proposition,String[],String,PropositionOrLiteral)</code>.
 Its documentation details how its semantics vary from a normal constuctor. 
 <p>There are two builtin <em>attribute classes</em> that must be supported
 in any implementation of this API. These are the Omega level attribute classes
 <code>Attribute</code> and <code>AttributeClass</code>. See 
 <a href="jtelos.OmegaAttributeClass">OmegaAttributeClass</a> for more details.
