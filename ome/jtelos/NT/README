Telos requires the creation of a directory named DB-FILES in the directory that
Telos is being executed in. Telos will create a file named telos-system.db in the
directory in which it is run that will hold information about the KBs created
during a Telos session. In subsequent sessions Telos will look for the file
telos-system.db in the current directory.
